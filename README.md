# 11 File Upload

This is an example of how a simple file upload app could look like.
It has an index.html file with a form containing a file upload.
The form should include an ' enctype="multipart/form-data"  ' attribute in order to function.

The documentation of the multer module can be found [here](https://github.com/expressjs/multer).
